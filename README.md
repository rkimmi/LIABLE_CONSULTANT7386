# LIABLE_CONSULTANT7386

An online chat room environment which speculates on notions of simulated alternative value economies. On entering the chatroom, individual user-identities are auto-generated with an auto-accredited arbitrary value, reinforcing their role as a homogenised worker or user. These usernames will be  created by randomly concatenated words relating to corporate, economic and governmental language — the first word a verb or adjective, second word noun, ending in a four digit numeric code, e.g; 

##### ‘authorised_climate7436’
##### ‘preemptive_metrics2197’


A virtual world fueled by a fast-paced economic cycle, whereby users are infinite and disposable.

The user’s assigned value — displayed in a starchart-like system — does not hold any weight but rather acts as a counterfeit; it cannot be exchanged or traded and exists only for display. The lifecycle of each user is short, as user identities are created upon entering and then die when exiting the chatroom. 

All combinations of username, icon and assigned value will be programmatically generated to be unique. All messages will be logged and accessible as a growing document.
